<p>
    I began my coding career in January of 2014. I had a worked in home improvement for seven years
previously. I enjoy the problem solving aspect of both careers equally. Coding gives me the
opportunity to be more creative and build things more fun to interact with. I started Omaha Code
School on February 23 and dedicated the next three months to training my processes and skills to
build things for the web. I left Code School confident I could build solid web applications. I
worked on a few freelance projects before taking an internship at Ervin &amp; Smith. They have a web
development department and a focus on marketing. I knew previously I could make a tested, complex
and efficient logic for an applivcation so being able to delve into SEO and working with talented
creative designers helped me gain appreciation for style and clean user&nbsp;interfaces.
