The highlight of my week all summer has been loading my one year old into my bike trailer and
heading down to the farmers market. On Sunday mornings at 8:30 there isn't much traffic and
drivers seem to have significantly more patience when they believe there is a child involved.
If you have young kids you can take hostage for a bike ride, I highly recommend it. Also a
decent set of rechargeable speakers bring a certain element of enjoyment that the whir of the
tires can not&nbsp;replace.

The SRAM Rival groupset held up pretty well with an additional load. I am going to switch out
the low gear with a 42t cog and swap it over to an X9 long cage [derailer](http://www.sheldonbrown.com/derailer.html)
because next year there is will two kiddos in the back. There were a few occasions I did not think
about the weight of my newly acquired fresh produce until I was in the middle of a hill dragging
60lbs of baby, trailer and&nbsp;groceries.
